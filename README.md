# MusicBoard
A Gorilla Tag mod where you can place .mp3 files into the MusicBoard folder inside your plugins and listen to music in game.

Instructions:

Place the "MusicBoard" folder into your plugins (it should have the .dll and 2 .mp3 files)
That's it it should work go enjoy!

Note: you need the "MusicBoard" folder without it, it won't detect the mp3 files.
